               <p>The 33-story residential building would stand at the corner of Davis Street and Chicago Avenue beside a 2-story landmarked building. The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and a Chase Bank drive-thru, according to the construction plan by Vermilion Enterprises, LLC, a Chicago real estate company.</p>
               <p>“It’s definitely an underutilized site and especially a missing tooth along Davis Street … and this project basically fills that in,” said Kerry Dickson, the director of residential real estate at Vermilion.</p>


               <p>Martha Koch, the owner of the landmarked building, said she had partnered with Vermilion to make sure the plan was designed with the preservation of the landmarked building in mind.</p>

               <p>Many attendees expressed their concerns through raising questions about the project.</p>

               <p>Carl Klein, a recent graduate in historic preservation, said sealing the 6-foot gap between the two buildings isn’t enough to protect the landmarked building from rain and would also make future restoration constructions harder. </p>

               <p>A few attendees were less critical of the project and made positive comments.</p>

               <p>Dale Bradley, 47, said he would move to Evanston soon and was glad the construction of the building could bring more people and jobs to the neighborhood.</p>

               <p>“I think it's nothing but an improvement,” Bradley said.</p>

               <p>The plan will be proposed to the Evanston Plan Commission for another review before it goes to the Evanston City Council for a vote.</p>
